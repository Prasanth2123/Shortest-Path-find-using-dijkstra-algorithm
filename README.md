This project finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm implemented from scratch (no libraries). 
It demonstrates algorithmic thinking, graph representation, and path reconstruction.

Dijkstra's algorithm systematically updates distances to each vertex starting from a source node, selecting the unvisited vertex with the smallest current distance each time.

- Number of vertices and edges
- Each edge as (u, v, weight)
- Source vertex

Displays the shortest distance and path to every vertex from the source.

- Time: O(VÂ²)
- Space: O(V + E)
